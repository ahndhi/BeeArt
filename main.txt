An old man is running errands. Most seem quite banal, but structure them in a way that they seem sketch once you know the whole story.
A few scenes in shops, then him with his bundles, riding a bus.
Back at his apartment/home, we see him prepare these ingredients into an incense, a ceremonial wash, and eventually a sacrifice.
He performs a dark ritual, and is consumed by the spirit he summons.
The end.

Thoughts on things to do with the space:

Electronics for artists - The goal is not to produce EEs, but to give people enough tools to help them get started and help them help themselves. Try to focus on practical knowledge instead of theory
- Components - what are they, how to read them, where to get them
- Circuit basics - reading schematics, bread boarding, what's a circuit?, requirements, and some basic circuits that come up a lot, soldering!!!
- Switches, especially tied into Power and Relays
- Power and safety - controlling large loads, power supplies, batteries and charging systems
- LEDs, blink 'em, sequence 'em, do a whole bunch, do a few, blow them up
- 555s, Low frequency on up through audio, using them as a timing signal for things like a 4017
- Motors and movement, types, methods of control
- Other lighting - incandescent, EL and odd balls
- Pre-built modules - how to find them, what are they good for
- Noise! APC, and ArtInst oscilators, contact mics, mic everything, DIY transducers
- MCUs, Arduino is a good start, ESPs are also fun, displays and other outputs, PWM i2c

Consider a few different classes, at least a basic/intro and something more advanced
- Transducers could easily be a whole class, as could MCUs
- Project based classes, APC, color changing light based on ESP thing, DIY guitar pickups, Contact mics, amplifiers, pedals and filters

Clubs
- Game makers meet up, monthly seems like plenty, brags/news, maybe do a presentation once a meeting, social time, and games to follow
- Tinkerer's Club, hack and electronics type meet up, circuit bending, show-and-tell, offer supplies and access to some of my resources like oscilloscope, and soldering iron

I would like to set up a meeting as my scams get worse, not better.

Electronics for artists - The goal is not to produce EEs, but to give people enough tools to help them get started and help them help themselves. Try to focus on practical knowledge instead of theory
- SAFETY: DC not AC, low current, lead and burns, Seriously no AC for now
	Never work on a circuit while power is applied.
	Do not connect power to a circuit until the circuit is finished and you have carefully checked your work.
	If you smell anything burning, immediately disconnect the power and examine your circuit to find out what went wrong.
	Be careful around large capacitors; they can continue to hold voltage long after they are disconnected from power.
	Be especially careful when you solder because a hot soldering iron can easily burn you.
	Always work in a well-ventilated space.
	Have safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher, a first-aid kit, and a phone nearby
	Keep your work area dry.
- Power - DC power supplies - wall warts, very common as a stage in larger circuits, batteries, much safer but comes with some limitations, we will get to AC and wall power but the focus will be on low power DC projects
- Circuit basics - A warning: some of this is going to be hard and boring. I'm mostly plowing throuigh that because the goal is provide you with some practical knowledge, but the more you know, the better you will be at this stuff, and the more you'll be able to accomplish. I strongly recommend doing the work and learning the basics for yourself. At least learn DC circuit theory. It's a little boring, and some of it is kinda hard, but just work through it.

what's a circuit?
	Requirements - Must be a circuit, work needs to be done, that describes the two most common problems - shorts and open circuits
	Voltage - Water Pressure, electromotive force
	Current - Water Volume, literally the number of electrons
	AC vs DC - power transmission, frequency hZ or cps, phase?, reactance and impedence (just note they are concepts that exist), sound, the concept of zero crossing and negative voltage, different waveforms
	Circuit Sims - Falstad, easy, fun and free!
Ohms Law e = i*r, triangle hand trick thing = E/i*r and cover the one you want
- Components - what are they, how to read them, basic overview of them and how we'll use them
	Resistors - series, parallel, pure resistance! The turn electricity into heat. Calculate the load on a resistor, markings and meanings
	Variable Resistors - pots, ldr, many type of sensors
	Capacitors - series, parallel, hold charge, they pass AC and can remove bias from a signal, however because they have reactance their "resistance" is frequency dependant, markings and meanings
	Magnetics - when electrons flow they can induce a charge in other nearby materials, this can create fields, additionally magnetic fields can induce charges in wires, by exploiting this properties we can make inductors, the counterpart to capacitors in some ways, mostly all we need to know about them, they come up sometimes, markings and meanings
	Switches - markings and meanings, relays
	Wire - it can really, really matter
	Discrete semiconductors - diodes first and use P/N explanation, transistors: there are a lot of types, but they all pretty much work the same, MOSFET and BJT, switches and amplifiers
	ICs - Basically just all of these things miniaturized and jammed into a little plastic package
Finish with a 555 blinker on the breadboard with a ldr
