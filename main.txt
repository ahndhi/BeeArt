A collection of devices built around an ESP8266 that are able to sense the strength of each others WiFi (RSSI) as a sort of proximity sensor. When in close enough proximity, the devices activate and play a sound, tone, beating tone, light, or haptics (,?). The concept branches from there:
- In one version, the devices are essentially all peers, and somewhat generically activate when they're near each other
- They could also be given unique identifiers and react differently based on which device is activating them
- They could each have a unique beat that gets closer to a median as they get closer
-- A more complex version could include knobs and buttons for users to adjust the volume, tone frequency, beat frequency and/or timing pause to match others. Could also build some of this into the device as an automatic response
- There could also be a distinction amongst the devices, some that are in fixed locations "flowers" of sorts that don't do much on their own, and "bees" which are dynamic and move with people.
-- Larger groups could cause different effects, and shifting groups. Each identified "bee" could cause the flower to act in different ways too

Items that stick to participants, or can be stuck to unwilling participants -- think Weenie stickers; they react in some way when the wearer passes too close to something or through something


An old man is running errands. Most seem quite banal, but structure them in a way that they seem sketch once you know the whole story.
A few scenes in shops, then him with his bundles, riding a bus.
Back at his apartment/home, we see him prepare these ingredients into an incense, a ceremonial wash, and eventually a sacrifice.
He performs a dark ritual, and is consumed by the spirit he summons.
The end.

Thoughts on things to do with the space:

Electronics for artists - The goal is not to produce EEs, but to give people enough tools to help them get started and help them help themselves. Try to focus on practical knowledge instead of theory
- Components - what are they, how to read them, where to get them
- Circuit basics - reading schematics, bread boarding, what's a circuit?, requirements, and some basic circuits that come up a lot, soldering!!!
- Switches, especially tied into Power and Relays
- Power and safety - controlling large loads, power supplies, batteries and charging systems
- LEDs, blink 'em, sequence 'em, do a whole bunch, do a few, blow them up
- 555s, Low frequency on up through audio, using them as a timing signal for things like a 4017
- Motors and movement, types, methods of control
- Other lighting - incandescent, EL and odd balls
- Pre-built modules - how to find them, what are they good for
- Noise! APC, and ArtInst oscilators, contact mics, mic everything, DIY transducers
- MCUs, Arduino is a good start, ESPs are also fun, displays and other outputs, PWM i2c

Consider a few different classes, at least a basic/intro and something more advanced
- Transducers could easily be a whole class, as could MCUs
- Project based classes, APC, color changing light based on ESP thing, DIY guitar pickups, Contact mics

Clubs
- Game makers meet up, monthly seems like plenty, brags/news, maybe do a presentation once a meeting, social time, and games to follow
- Tinkerer's Club, hack and electronics type meet up, circuit bending, show-and-tell, offer supplies and access to some of my resources like oscilloscope, and soldering iron


Electronics for artists - The goal is not to produce EEs, but to give people enough tools to help them get started and help them help themselves. Try to focus on practical knowledge instead of theory
- Power and safety - power supplies, batteries, SAFETY
- Circuit basics - what's a circuit?, requirements, Ohms Law
- Components - what are they, how to read them, basic overview of them and how we'll use them
Finish with a 555 blinker on the breadboard with a ldr

- Circuit basics - reading schematics, bread boarding
- LEDs, blink 'em, sequence 'em, do a whole bunch, do a few, blow them up
- Other lighting - incandescent, EL and odd balls
- 555s, Low frequency

- Circuit basics - reading schematics, bread boarding, and some basic circuits that come up a lot
- 555s, audio, using them as a timing signal for things like a 4017, online calculators
- Noise! APC

- PWM
- Transistors as switches, controlling large loads
- Motors and movement, types, methods of control
- Circuit basics - reading schematics, bread boarding, and some basic circuits that come up a lot, Pre-built modules - how to find them, what are they good for

- Noise! In a bigger way, ArtInst oscilators, contact mics, mic everything, DIY transducers, amps and classes of amp, op amps, transistors in audio circuits
- analog v digital
- MCUs, Arduino is a good start, ESPs are also fun, displays and other outputs, PWM i2c

- Power and safety - power supplies, battery charging systems
- Switches, especially tied into Power and Relays
- Circuit basics - breadboard to circuit, soldering!!!
