A collection of devices built around an ESP8266 that are able to sense the strength of each others WiFi (RSSI) as a sort of proximity sensor. When in close enough proximity, the devices activate and play a sound, tone, beating tone, light, or haptics (,?). The concept branches from there:
- In one version, the devices are essentially all peers, and somewhat generically activate when they're near each other
- They could also be given unique identifiers and react differently based on which device is activating them
- They could each have a unique beat that gets closer to a median as they get closer
-- A more complex version could include knobs and buttons for users to adjust the volume, tone frequency, beat frequency and/or timing pause to match others. Could also build some of this into the device as an automatic response
- There could also be a distinction amongst the devices, some that are in fixed locations "flowers" of sorts that don't do much on their own, and "bees" which are dynamic and move with people.
-- Larger groups could cause different effects, and shifting groups. Each identified "bee" could cause the flower to act in different ways too


Items that stick to participants, or can be stuck to unwilling participants -- think Weenie stickers; they react in some way when the wearer passes too close to something or through something
