***Electronics for artists - The goal is not to produce EEs, but to give people enough tools to help them get started and help them help themselves. Try to focus on practical knowledge instead of theory

***SAFETY***:
	No wall power!
	We're working with low current
	Lead - it's honestly the best solder, also electronics in general contain a variety of heavy metals. Wash your hands.
	Burns are possible, particulrly when soldering
	Never work on a circuit while power is applied.
	Do not connect power to a circuit until the circuit is finished and you have carefully checked your work.
	If you smell anything burning, immediately disconnect the power and examine your circuit to find out what went wrong.
	Be careful around large capacitors; they can continue to hold voltage long after they are disconnected from power..
	Always work in a well-ventilated space.
	Have safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher, a first-aid kit, and a phone nearby
	Keep your work area dry.
***SI Units***
	We gotta know 'em:
	p pico = 	0.000 000 000 001
	n nano = 	0.000 000 001
	μ micro = 	0.000 001
	m milli = 	0.001
	BASE
	k kilo = 	1,000
	M mega = 	1,000,000
	G giga = 	1,000,000,000
***Circuit Basics*** A warning: This is the meat and potatoes of electronics, but it is rarely well seasoned. I'm mostly plowing through because the goal is provide you with some practical knowledge, but the more you know, the better you will be at this stuff, and the more you'll be able to accomplish. I strongly recommend doing the work and learning the basics for yourself. At least learn DC circuit theory. It's a little boring, and some of it is kinda hard, but just work through it.

***What's a circuit?***
	Requirements - Must be a circuit, work needs to be done even if it's heat, that describes the two most common problems - shorts and open circuits
	Voltage - Water Pressure, electromotive force, measured in volts, usually somewhat fixed, an actual circuit will "drop" its voltage one way or another, as heat if nothing else
	Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law says that if you add all the voltage drops in a circuit – you get the voltage of the power supply.
	Current - Water Volume, literally the number of electrons, measured in amps, usually not fixed, but a circuit will "draw" as much current as it needs
	Kirchhoff’s current law says: All the current going into a node is equal to all the current that goes out from the node. - “What goes in must come out”
	Resistance - pretty much everything has a resistance, even wire, even batteries, measured in ohms Ω
	AC vs DC - Bare bones, what do they look like?
		AC is good for power transmission
		Frequency as a general concept
		Sound
		Negative voltage
***Ohms Law***
	e = i*r
	They are inherently linked measurements in a circuit
	triangle hand trick thing = E/i*r and cover the one you want
	12v = ? * 120Ω - 0.1A
	? = 500mA * 100kΩ - 50kv
	6Mv = 3kA * ? - 2000Ω
	Watts = voltage * amperage
***Power***
	DC power supplies - batteries for now, cheap, easy, and safe
	DC in general is less likely to shock you. We're also focusing on stuff in the milliamp range. 1A will give you a good shock, and anything over 2A can kill.
	Limits things like motors and "big" projects, but we'll get there.
	We will get to AC and wall power but the focus will be on low power DC projects
***Components*** - what are they, how to read them, basic overview of them and how we'll use them
	Series vs parallel definition
	Through hole or DIP, SMD is the future, but they're extremely small and not beginner friendly
	Resistors
		Pure resistance! little pucks of stuff that conducts electricity, but not well
		Measured in ohms milli - Giga+ are available, but BASE through Mega are most common
		Series - additive, handle more power too
		Parallel - if even R/# if not R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 ... not common
		Voltage Divider - The voltage mid point of two resistors can be expressed as a percentage of the two resistors, we'll come back to these R2/(R1+R2)
		The turn electricity into heat
		Calculate the load on a resistor in watts
		Markings and Meanings https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/resistor-color-codes/
	Variable Resistors
		Potentiometers or pots, rotary or linear, tons of different values, linear or audio taper/log, ganged and switched, usually three terminals - both ends and wiper, makes a voltage divider
		Trimmers, basically pots but only meant to be adjusted a few times
		Light dependant resistors, good old fun, limited
		Many type of sensors, thermistors, flex, force, linear soft things
	Capacitors
		Two plates with a dielectric in-between, when one develops a charge, the other develops a negative charge
		Measured in Farads, pico - BASE are available, but micro is most common
		Series - they loose capacitance, it's usually a weird thing to do
		Parallel - additive, but also not common
		Can be dangerous as they can hold a charge
		They pass AC, but not DC
		Common in everything, ued for filtering and keeping signals nice and clean, smoothing out ripples in current, and timing
		Some are polarized!
		Sometimes polarity is noted, usually on electrolytics
		Ceramics are sometimes coded, usually three numbers the firt two are the value and the third is a multiplier counting up from the pico level. It's sort of dumb. 
	Magnetics
		When electrons flow they can induce a charge in other nearby materials, this can create magnetic fields, additionally magnetic fields can induce charges in conductors, by exploiting this properties we can make inductors, the counterpart to capacitors in some ways
		For now that's mostly all we need to know about them, they come up sometimes
		Examples include transducers, electromagnets, transformers, and filters
		Measured in Henrys and sometimes other esoteric things
	Switches
		SPST - Single pole, single throw
		SPDT - Single pole, double throw
		DPDT - Double pole, double throw, or whatever # of poles and throws
		NO - normally open
		NC - normally closed
		Momentary, and latching
		Maximum ratings
		Relays, a type of electrically operated switch, handy for certain large loads, can be loud
	Wire - it can really, really matter
		There are some special magical wires out there, but we probably won't run into most of them
		Mostly, we'll be concerned with AWG and current handling
		The insulation material can matter as a function of power handling
		Stranded - flexible, good for longer runs or things that need to remain flexible, usually cheaper, lower power handling especially for DC
		Solid - not as flexible, holds its shape, will break if bent too much, great for breadboards and DIY circuit projects, generally a little more expensive
		Magnet wire will also come up, available in all sorts of guages, it has a very thin enamal coating
	Discrete semiconductors
		N - Has spare electrons - essentially "conductive"
		P - Is said to have "holes" - essentially  "non-conductive" until a those holes get filled by applying a charge
		If we imagine a device made up of two layers of those materials: NP first electrons won't flow, then PN and they will flow but only in one direction
		That's a diode! Only allows current flow in one direction. Very handy in things like rectifiers and distortion pedals
		LEDs - diodes that happen to emit light
		Take our NP chunk, add another N on the other side - electrons can't bridge that gap, that is unless will fill those holes with our own electrons! Functionally a switch, we could probably even build in such a way that the current into the P region only needs to be very small while the other current can be very large!
		What if, same thing but we're only turning on the P region a little bit, or varying it? It would be a small signal controlling a larger amount of power. That's the basis of amplification.
		Transistors: there are a lot of types, but they all pretty much work the same - some are best as switches, some have a large linear region, NPN, PNP, BJT, MOSFET, N-Channel and P-Channel, IGBT, JFET
	ICs - Basically just all of these things miniaturized and jammed into a little plastic package
