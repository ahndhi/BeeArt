***Electronics for artists - The goal is not to produce EEs, but to give people enough tools to help them get started and help them help themselves. Try to focus on practical knowledge instead of theory

***SAFETY***:
	No wall power!
	We're working low current
	Lead - it's honestly the bet solder, also electronics in general contain a variety of heavy metal. Wash your hands.
	Burns are possible, particulrly when soldering
	Never work on a circuit while power is applied.
	Do not connect power to a circuit until the circuit is finished and you have carefully checked your work.
	If you smell anything burning, immediately disconnect the power and examine your circuit to find out what went wrong.
	Be careful around large capacitors; they can continue to hold voltage long after they are disconnected from power.
	Be especially careful when you solder because a hot soldering iron can easily burn you.
	Always work in a well-ventilated space.
	Have safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher, a first-aid kit, and a phone nearby
	Keep your work area dry.
***SI Units***
	We gotta know 'em:
	p pico = 	0.000 000 000 001
	n nano = 	0.000 000 001
	μ micro = 	0.000 001
	m milli = 	0.001
	BASE
	k kilo = 	1,000
	M mega = 	1,000,000
	G giga = 	1,000,000,000
***Circuit Basics*** A warning: This is the meat and potatoes of electronics, but it is rarely well seasoned. I'm mostly plowing throuigh that because the goal is provide you with some practical knowledge, but the more you know, the better you will be at this stuff, and the more you'll be able to accomplish. I strongly recommend doing the work and learning the basics for yourself. At least learn DC circuit theory. It's a little boring, and some of it is kinda hard, but just work through it.

***What's a circuit?***
	Requirements - Must be a circuit, work needs to be done even if it's heat, that describes the two most common problems - shorts and open circuits
	Voltage - Water Pressure, electromotive force, measured in volts, usually somewhat fixed, an actual circuit will "drop" its voltage one way or another, as heat if nothing else
	Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law says that if you add all the voltage drops in a circuit – you get the voltage of the power supply.
	Current - Water Volume, literally the number of electrons, measured in amps, usually not fixed, but a circuit will "draw" as much current as it needs
	Kirchhoff’s current law says: All the current going into a node is equal to all the current that goes out from the node. - “What goes in must come out”
	Resistance - pretty much everything has a resistance, measured in ohms Ω
	AC vs DC - Bare bones, what do they look like?
		AC is good for power transmission
		Frequency as a general concept
		Sound
		Negative voltage
***Ohms Law***
	e = i*r
	They are inherently linked measurements in a circuit
	triangle hand trick thing = E/i*r and cover the one you want
	12v = ? * 120Ω - 0.1A
	? = 500mA * 100kΩ - 50kv
	6Mv = 3kA * ? - 2000Ω
	Watts = voltage * amperage
***Power***
	DC power supplies - batteries for now, cheap, easy, and safe
	DC in general is less likely to shock you. We're also focusing on stuff in the milliamp range. 1A will give you a good shock, and anything over 2A can kill.
	Limits things like motors and "big" projects, but we'll get there.
	we will get to AC and wall power but the focus will be on low power DC projects
***Components*** - what are they, how to read them, basic overview of them and how we'll use them
	Series vs parallel definition
	Through hole or DIP, SMD is the future, but they're extremely small and not beginner friendly
	Resistors
		Pure resistance! little pucks of stuff that conducts electricity, but not well
		Measured in ohms milli - Mega+ are available, but BASE through Mega are most common
		Series - additive, handle more power too
		Parallel - if even R/# if not R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 ... not common
		Voltage Divider - The voltage mid point of two resistors can be expressed as a percentage of the two resistors, we'll come back to these
		The turn electricity into heat
		Calculate the load on a resistor in watts
		Markings and Meanings https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/resistor-color-codes/
	Variable Resistors
		Potentiometers or pots, rotary or linear, tons of different values, linear or audio taper/log, ganged and switched, usually three terminals - both ends and wiper, makes a voltage divider
		Light dependant resistors, good old fun, limited
		Many type of sensors, thermistors, flex, force, linear soft things
	Capacitors
		Two plates with a dielectric in-between, when one develops a charge, the other develops a negative charge
		Measured in Farads, pico - BASE are available, but micro is most common
		Series - they loose capacitance, it's usually a weird thing to do
		Parallel - they add, but also not common
		Can be dangerous as they can hold a charge
		They pass AC, but not DC
		Common in everything, ued for filtering and keeping signals nice and clean, smoothing out ripples in current, and timing
		Some are polarized!
		Sometimes polarity is noted, usually on electrolytics
		Ceramics are sometimes coded, usually three numbers the firt two are the value and the third is a multiplier counting up from the pico level. It's sort of dumb. 
	Magnetics
		When electrons flow they can induce a charge in other nearby materials, this can create magnetic fields, additionally magnetic fields can induce charges in conductors, by exploiting this properties we can make inductors, the counterpart to capacitors in some ways
		For now that's mostly all we need to know about them, they come up sometimes
		Examples include transducers, electromagnets, transformers, and filters
		Measured in Henrys and sometimes other esoteric things
	Switches - markings and meanings, relays
	Wire - it can really, really matter
	Discrete semiconductors - diodes first and use P/N explanation, LEDs, transistors: there are a lot of types, but they all pretty much work the same, MOSFET and BJT, switches and amplifiers
	ICs - Basically just all of these things miniaturized and jammed into a little plastic package
Finish with a 555 blinker on the breadboard with a ldr


***Circuit Basics***
	Reading schematics
	Bread boarding
***Power*** - DC power supplies
	batteries - great option, cheap, plentiful, maany rechargeable options, but buy a decent charger. Battery charging can be pretty sketch, and lithium fires are no joke.
	wall warts, these days they are switch mode power supplies - much lighter but sometimes noisey and not always good for audio
	very common as a stage in larger circuits
	Voltage regulators
- Source and sink, reading data sheets
- LEDs, blink 'em, sequence 'em, do a whole bunch, do a few, blow them up
- Other lighting - incandescent, EL and odd balls
- Beeping buzzers
- 4017
- 555s, Low frequency


***Circuit Basics***
	Some basic circuits that come up a lot
	Reading data sheets
- 555 and 556 audio
	AC vs DC - Bare bones, what do they look like?
		AC is good for power transmission
		Frequency hZ or cps
		RMS
		Phase
		Reactance and impedence (just note they are concepts that exist)
		Sound, but also Noise
		The concept of zero crossing and negative voltage
		Different waveforms
- Noise! APC


- PWM
- Transistors as switches, controlling large loads
- Motors and movement, types, methods of control
- Circuit basics - reading schematics, bread boarding, and some basic circuits that come up a lot, Pre-built modules - how to find them, what are they good for


- Noise! In a bigger way, ArtInst oscilators, contact mics, mic everything, DIY transducers, amps and classes of amp, op amps, transistors in audio circuits
- analog v digital
- They pass AC and can remove bias from a signal, however because they have reactance their "resistance" is frequency dependant, filters
- MCUs, Arduino is a good start, ESPs are also fun, displays and other outputs, PWM i2c


- Power and safety - power supplies, battery charging systems
- Switches, especially tied into Power and Relays
- Circuit basics - breadboard to circuit, soldering!!!
